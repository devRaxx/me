          <p>
            I'm a front-end developer passionate about building fast,
            accessible, and user-centered web experiences. With hands-on
            experience in React, Next.js, and Tailwind, Iâ€™ve shipped scalable
            solutions for startups, student organizations, and tech communities.
            Whether it's automating event platforms, redesigning high-traffic
            pages, or creating interactive UI for civic tech, I bring clean code
            and thoughtful design to every project.
